# ABSTRACT
This research aims to build a "Learning resource sharing system" for students and teachers to meet the needs of finding learning and research materials, ensuring standard document sources, saving time and money. student fees. The system is built according to the steps in the software development process with the functions of searching, evaluating, commenting, and sharing learning resources. Discussion topics and learning resources are managed by grade level and subject for convenience in searching.
In particular, the title of the discussion topic and the content of the learning resource are indexed and stored with the Mongodb database management system as the foundation for building content-based search functions as well as duplicate checking between learning resources. We use the Jaccard measure to compare the overlap between learning resources, the TF-IDF weight and the Cosine measure to determine the match between users’ information needs and discussion topics as well as as learning resources available on the system.
